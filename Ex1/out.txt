Song: Heat Waves - Artist: Glass Animals
(Last night all I think about is you
Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't wanna but I think about you
You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision

Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



Usually I put somethin' on TV

So we never think about you and me

But today I see our reflections clearly

In Hollywood, layin' on the screen

You just need a better life than this

You need somethin' I can never give

Fake water all across the road

It's gone now, the night has come, but



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



You can't fight it, you can't breathe

You say somethin' so lovin', but

Now I gotta let you go

You'll be better off in someone new

I don't wanna be alone

You know it hurts me too

You look so broken when you cry

One more and then I say goodbye



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



I just wonder what you're dreamin' of

When you sleep and smile so comfortable

I just wish that I could give you that

That look that's perfectly un-sad

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Heat waves been fakin' me out



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



Road shimmer wigglin' the vision

Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision

Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror----------------------------
Song: We Don't Talk About Bruno - Artist: Carolina Gaitan, Mauro Castillo, Adassa, Rhenzy Feliz, Diane Guerrero, Stephanie Beatriz & Encanto Cast
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno, but
It was my wedding day
It was our wedding day
We were getting ready

And there wasn't a cloud in the sky

No clouds allowed in the sky

Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin

Thunder

You telling this story or am I?

I'm sorry, mi vida, go on

Bruno says, "It looks like rain"

Why did he tell us?

In doing so, he floods my brain

Abuela, get the umbrellas

Married in a hurricane

What a joyous day but anyway



We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no

We don't talk about Bruno



Hey, grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling

I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling

I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch ch ch

It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling

Always left Abuela and the family fumbling

Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand

Do you understand?

A seven-foot frame, rats along his back

When he calls your name it all fades to black

Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams (Hey)



We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no

We don't talk about Bruno



He told me my fish would die, the next day, dead (No, no)

He told me I'd grow a gut and just like he said (No, no)

He said that all my hair would disappear, now, look at my head (No, no)

Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read



He told me that the life of my dreams

Would be promised, and someday be mine

He told me that my power would grow

Like the grapes that thrive on the vine (Óye, Mariano's on his way)

He told me that the man of my dreams

Would be just out of reach

Betrothed to another

It's like I hear him, now

Hey sis, I want not a sound out of you

It's like I can hear him now, I can hear him, now



Um, Bruno

Yeah, about that Bruno

I really need to know about Bruno

Gimme the truth and the whole truth, Bruno (Isabela, your boyfriend's here)

Time for dinner

A seven-foot frame, rats along his back (It was my wedding day, it was our wedding day )

When he calls your name it all fades to black (We were getting ready and there wasn't a cloud in the sky)

Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams (Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin)

You telling this story or am I?



Óye, Mariano's on his way

Bruno says, "It looks like rain" (He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach)

In doing so, he floods my brain (Betrothed to another, another)

Married in a hurricane (And I'm fine, and I'm fine, and I'm fine, I'm fine)

He's here

Don't talk about Bruno, no

Why did I talk about Bruno?

Not a word about Bruno

I never shoulda brought up Bruno----------------------------
Song: abcdefu - Artist: GAYLE
I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection

It's like you'd do anything for my affection

You're goin' all about it in the worst ways



I was into you, but I'm over it now

And I was tryna be nice

But nothing's getting through, so let me spеll it out



A-B-C-D-E, fuck you

And your mom and your sister and your job

And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art

Fuck you and your friends that I'll nеver see again

Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off



Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah-nah

A-B-C-D-E, fuck you



You said you just needed space and so I gave it

When I had nothin' to say you couldn't take it

Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it

Always had to put yourself above me



I was into you, but I'm over it now

And I was tryna be nice

But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out



A-B-C-D-E, fuck you

And your mom and your sister and your job

And your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds

Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again

Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off



Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah-nah

A-B-C-D-E, fuck off

Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah-nah

A-B-C-D-E, fuck you



And your mom and your sister and your job

And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art

Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again

Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off----------------------------
Song: Super Gremlin - Artist: Kodak Black
Yeah, we could be superstars
We been rather wreckin' cars (Ayy bro, is that Jambo?)
What is at stake for us?
Kickin' off power mirrors
Yeah, we could be superstars
But I'm pretty sure our time is up

And so we fell off the spinning tops

Don't know, maybe for trial

But way more error (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)



Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer

Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you

Go against any nigga, like, fuck this glitter

Skeet off third, I'm busy

I put it in for you, I spin for you

Whatever you with, I'm with it

How you gon' cross a nigga that was rockin' with you? I got you lit in the city

I been multitaskin', rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children

I been standin' on business, and spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy

I do all the smackin', you ain't never stepped or helped with none of this killin'

You doin' a lot of cappin', watch when I catch you, I'ma whack you in front of thе witness



Damn, my nigga, you trippin'

We could've been supеrstars

Remember when we was jackin' cars

Now, it's not safe for you

You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch

Damn, my nigga, you trippin'

We could've been superstars

Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing

Remember when we was jackin' cars

Now, you better keep your distance

'Cause it's not safe for you

You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch



Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on the bitch when I slide

Nightlight on the blick, bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside

Zoe done ran down, caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted

I knew the Perc' was fake, but I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin



Yeah, Kutthroat Businezz, KTB, backdoor wide open

Wait 'til my sniper get out, all you niggas gon' die, time rollin'

Bustin' on my opponent, no half-steppin', crushin' my opps totally

We was just broke with no motion

Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches

I done went cages, to stages, to cages

Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby

I beat them cases, they already hate me

They gon' want me dead when I'm on probation

Oh, y'all think lil' Yak retarded?

Y'all ain't seen none yet, I promise

Niggas can't take me, niggas can't guard me

I be on a fuck nigga ass like Charmin

AK, twenty-inch carbon



We could've been superstars

Remember when we was jackin' cars

Now, it's not safe for you

You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch

Damn, my nigga, you trippin'

We could've been superstars

Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing

Remember when we was jackin' cars

Now, you better keep your distance

'Cause it's not safe for you

You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch



Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on the bitch when I slide

Nightlight on the blick, bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside

Zoe done ran down, caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted

I knew the Perc' was fake, but I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin



Yeah, we could be superstars (Super Gremlin)

But I'm pretty sure our time is up (Now your time is up)

And so we fell off the spinning tops

Don't know, maybe for trial, but way more error

I ain't slimy, I'm grimy

Any way you put it, I'm SG with it, I'm Super Gremlin

Snatch and grab, sneak and geek, Sniper Gang, trust

Nightmare, baby, you know I-

I bet you always see me in your dreams
